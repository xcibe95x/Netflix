## Leading the Pack
During the journey i will assign tasks to the members, eventually assign a task to myself and review and adjust the code to reach the desired level of quality.
For ease of use i first tried some shady hacks, but than opeted for Cloudflare Pages, and hosted a real time page, than i setup a DNS to a subdomain URL pointing to my website for my team.
I webhooked the repo to our private discord channel, so i can monitor any action easily, everytime something happens, eg. somebody push, so i can continuosly monitor  my team actions.
